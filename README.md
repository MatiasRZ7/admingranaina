La Granaina Admin dashboard

This project is a full-stack web application built with Next.js. It's designed to manage collections, products, customers and orders in an online store.




Tech Stack

Frontend: 
The frontend is built with Next.js, a React framework that enables features like server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
UI Components: We're using a combination of custom UI components and components from the lucide-react library.

Routing: Routing is handled by Next.js Router, which allows for dynamic routing and supports both client-side and server-side routing.

Styling: Styling is done using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

Backend: The backend API is built with Next.js API routes, which allows us to build our API endpoints with the same simplicity as Next.js pages.

Data Fetching: Data fetching is done using the Fetch API to interact with the backend API routes.

This application uses Clerk for user management and authentication.

I used Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management service to upload images and then display them in https://granaina-store.vercel.app
